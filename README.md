# Pi Bug Board

A prototyping mounting board for Raspberry Pi, including space for a speaker, Pi camera, switches and potentiometers, sensors and leds.

Includes mounting holes for unlimited configutartions of the Raspberry Pi A, B and Zero, plus most Hats, Phats and add-on boards.

Has four holes in the corners for M8 bolts - this allows it to stand on a desk or combine boards for a more solid structure.

Works best laser cut in 3mm acrylic, looks best in 3mm laser plywood - however in plywood is a little 'flimsy' on its own, it works well when bolted with an acrilic board.

The mounting points to the right of the speaker were specifically designed for the Pimoroni Scroll Phat HD, and the Pimoroni Speaker Phat below that, however other holes have been included to allow other uses.
